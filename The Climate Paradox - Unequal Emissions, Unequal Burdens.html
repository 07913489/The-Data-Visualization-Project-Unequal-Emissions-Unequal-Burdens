        <h2>Overview of the Issue</h2>
        <p>
            The world is facing a dual crisis: the rapidly increasing impact of climate change and the deeply unequal distribution of its effects. 
            This story focuses on a sobering paradox: countries with the lowest per capita carbon emissions—mostly in the developing world—are bearing the heaviest burden of climate change. 
            Meanwhile, nations with the highest emissions have fortified themselves against these challenges, leveraging wealth and technological advancements to adapt and protect their populations.

            The first visualization paints a striking picture of inequality. Viewers can choose the countries they are interested in and check their population surge and climate change annually. 
            On one hand, countries with huge amounts of money like Qatar and Kuwait emit over 30 metric tons of CO₂ per capita annually, showcasing their wealth and industrial strength, yet they sit comfortably in the "Low Risk" category of climate vulnerability. On the other hand, nations like Chad, Niger, and Eritrea, whose per capita emissions are less than 0.5 metric tons, are positioned in the "Extreme Risk" category. 
            This discrepancy highlights a harsh reality: countries that contribute almost nothing to global emissions are the ones most vulnerable to its impacts.
            The lower part of this visualization contextualizes these disparities within the broader timeline of climate change. From 1950 to 2023, the global population exploded, and the temperature anomaly shifted from predominantly negative to consistently positive, signifying the undeniable progression of global warming. However, this warming is not evenly felt or mitigated. <a href='https://unfccc.int/files/press/backgrounders/application/pdf/factsheet_africa.pdf' target="_blank">According to the World Bank</a>, African nations, which are responsible for just 3% of global emissions, experience 70% of the worst climate impacts, such as droughts, floods, and extreme heat waves.
            This unequal burden is further exacerbated by a lack of resources. <a href='https://www.unep.org/resources/adaptation-gap-report-2023' target="_blank">UNEP Emissions Gap Report</a> reveals that while developing nations need an estimated $300 billion annually by 2030 for climate adaptation, they currently receive less than 25% of the necessary funding. This underfunding leaves vulnerable countries trapped in a cycle of environmental degradation and economic instability.

        <h2>Regional Carbon Emission Trends</h2>
        <iframe src="Annual CO2 Emissions by Continent.html" width="100%" height="600px" style="border: none;"></iframe>
        <p>
            <p>
                The second visualization provides an interactive tool to explore historical carbon emission trends by continent. It reveals how Africa, despite its growing population, has consistently remained the lowest emitter of CO₂ per capita compared to other regions.
                For instance, during the late 20th century, Europe's emissions peaked at over 10 metric tons per capita, while Africa barely exceeded 1 metric ton. More troubling is the recent divergence: while continents like Europe and North America have started reducing their emissions, Africa's per capita emissions remain stagnant, widening the gap.
                Historical data shows this trend is rooted in systemic inequities. A 2022 report by the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/africa-energy-outlook-2022" target="_blank">International Energy Agency (IEA)</a> highlights that over 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa still lack access to electricity, limiting their industrial development and leaving them ill-equipped to mitigate or adapt to climate change. Meanwhile, wealthy nations, benefitting from centuries of industrialization, continue to export emissions-intensive industries to developing countries while fortifying their own infrastructure.
            </p>

            <p>
                Countries like Mozambique and Zimbabwe illustrate the human cost of this inequity. Ranked among the most affected by climate-related disasters over the past decade by the <a href='https://ccpi.org/' target='_blank'>Climate Risk Index (2023)</a>, these nations face devastating cyclones and floods while contributing less than 0.1% to global emissions. In contrast, the United States, responsible for nearly 25% of historical CO₂ emissions, invests billions in climate adaptation technologies, safeguarding its population from similar disasters.

        <h2>Why This Story Matters</h2>
        <p>
            This issue transcends borders. The climate crisis, while disproportionately impacting the Global South, has cascading effects on the entire world. Unchecked climate change in vulnerable regions can lead to mass migration, resource conflicts, and economic instability that ripple globally. Highlighting these inequities is crucial for building a fairer, more sustainable future.
        </p>
        <p>
            By shedding light on the unequal distribution of climate impacts and resources, this story calls for a renewed focus on justice in climate policy. The world must move toward equitable solutions where no nation is left behind in the fight against climate change.
