# SI 649 Final Exam: Climate Paradox - Unequal Emissions, Unequal Burdens

This project explores the stark inequities in global carbon emissions and the unequal burden of climate change faced by developing nations. The project provides interactive visualizations and data-driven insights to highlight how the countries contributing the least to global CO₂ emissions are suffering the most from climate change impacts.

## Key Features

### 1. **Visualizing Global Climate Vulnerability and Resource Inequality**
[View the Tableau Public Here](https://public.tableau.com/views/UnequalBurdenTheParadoxofClimateVulnerability/Dashboard1?:language=zh-CN&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
- An interactive scatter plot shows the correlation between per capita CO₂ emissions and climate vulnerability.
- Insights:
  - Nations like Qatar and Kuwait emit over **30 metric tons of CO₂ per capita** yet remain in the "Low Risk" category.
  - African countries such as Chad, Niger, and Eritrea emit less than **0.5 metric tons per capita** but fall in the "Extreme Risk" zone.
- Contextual background:
  - A timeline from **1950 to 2023** demonstrates explosive population growth and a shift in global temperature anomalies from negative to positive values, underscoring the reality of global warming.

### 2. **Exploring Regional Carbon Emission Trends**
- A line chart enables users to interactively explore carbon emission trends by continent over time.
- Insights:
  - Africa’s per capita emissions have consistently remained the lowest, barely exceeding **1 metric ton** during the late 20th century.
  - In contrast, Europe peaked at over **10 metric tons per capita**, and the gap between Africa and other continents has widened in recent decades.
- Supporting data:
  - According to the **International Energy Agency (IEA)**, over **600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa** lack access to electricity, limiting their industrial development.

## Objectives
This project aims to:
1. Highlight the systemic inequities in carbon emissions and climate resilience.
2. Provide actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders to address climate justice.
3. Engage audiences with interactive visualizations to deepen their understanding of global climate disparities.

## Data Sources
- **Historical Data Provided**: The Original Data including population, annual CO2 emission and so on.
- **ND-GAIN INDEX**: The ND-GAIN Country Index summarizes a country's vulnerability to climate change and other global challenges in combination with its readiness to improve resilience. 
- **World Bank**: Carbon emissions and population data.
- **UNEP Emissions Gap Report**: Funding needs for climate adaptation in developing nations.
- **International Energy Agency (IEA)**: Data on electricity access and industrial development in sub-Saharan Africa.

## Visualizations

### 1. **Scatter Plot: Climate Vulnerability vs. CO₂ Emissions**
- Use this visualization to:
  - Identify countries at extreme risk and their CO₂ emission levels.
  - Compare regional disparities in climate resilience.

### 2. **Line Chart: Annual CO₂ Emissions by Continent**
- Interact with the brush tool to:
  - Explore emission trends for specific historical periods.
  - Compare Africa’s per capita emissions with other continents.

## Why This Matters
The project sheds light on a critical issue: developing nations contribute the least to global emissions but face the worst consequences of climate change. This disparity demands urgent attention to:
- Increase climate finance commitments, ensuring vulnerable nations receive adequate support.
- Hold high-emission countries accountable for their disproportionate contributions to global warming.

## Future Works
- Incorporating more granular data on climate impacts at the city level.
- Adding predictive models to forecast future emission trends and vulnerabilities.
- Exploring the socioeconomic dimensions of climate change, such as migration and resource conflicts.
